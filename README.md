## Course overview and goals

This course is designed to give students hands-on experience conducting ecological research related to forest ecology, restoration, and/or remote sensing techniques. The program is designed for one-semester program, but in some cases, projects may be continued to be expanded in a second semester. The course emphasizes reading primary scientific literature, data processing, analysis and written and oral presentation of research.

In this course, students will

- start and complete an independent research project related to forest restoration ecology,
- gain experience with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation,
- gain experience and reading and critically reviewing peer-reviewed scientific literature,
- present results through a short scientific paper and poster.

The aim of the course is to give students experience and practice applying the scientific method to ecological concepts, provide students with an introduction to methods for collecting and interpreting ecological data, and prepare students for future research endeavors in graduate professional school or career in natural resources.

# Hours, credit, and grading

In accordance with a  3-credit hour course , students will be expected to spend approximately 9 hours each week, totaling 135 total hours for each enrolled semester (15 weeks). For a 2-credit course, the expectation is approximately 6 hours per week, totaling 90 hours. These hours include time spent in individual or group meetings; conducting research, data collection, and analysis; guided reading and writing; and working on reports or presentations. Please keep track of your hours in a spreadsheet. Hours are logged by students and checked periodically by the instructor to ensure goals and objectives can be met in the time
available. Logging progress is helpful to ensure that projects are completed in an appropriate timeframe.

To receive credit for this course, students must satisfactorily (1) complete independent
project (described below), research paper, and poster presentation, (2) complete and track all
required hours as described above, and (3) adhere to the project timeline and assignment
due dates outlined below. Given the variability in individual student projects, some
portions of this timeline can be adjusted with permission from the instructor. The final
grade in this course is calculated using a traditional A–F scale based on the number of points
earned for assignments including an annotated bibliography, components of research article,
in-class activities, and development and presentation of a research poster. Individual
assignment details and rubrics can be found on the course Canvas page.

# Past projects and students

Factors influencing large-scale interactions between wind damage and fire (Geon Ho Kim)
Forest disturbances from wind damage and fire often have predictable influences on forest
structure, composition, and spatial patterns. When disturbances co-occur, they may interact
in a synergistic way such that a forest disturbance may increase the probability, intensity, or
severity of a second disturbance. In Fall 2018, Geon Ho Kim’s independent research showed
that wind damage and fire disturbances generally demonstrate buffering effects where wind
damage decreased the severity of subsequent fires, and noted that this interaction attenuated
for higher fire severity. Several factors such as time between disturbances, wildfire type, and
climate and weather conditions may help predict when disturbance interactions are
synergistic or antagonistic. This independent study will continue Geon Ho’s earlier research
and extend his examination of two publically available databases including the NOAA
Storm Prediction Center’s severe weather database cataloguing tornados since 1950, and the
USGS Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database tracking large fires since 1984.His
expanded study will focus on incorporating climatological data, disturbance timing, and
disturbance severity to better understand which factors drive changes in disturbance
interactions. This project requires advanced experience in GIS and experience with R.
Results, interpretation, and conclusions will be presented in a final report and in a research
poster presentation. Participation in CURC research symposium or other venue is
encouraged.
