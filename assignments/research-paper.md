# Completing an original research paper

## Learning goals

This assignment is designed to allow you to demonstrate your knowledge in the following areas:

1) communicating an original hypothesis using rationale from the scientific literature,
2) communicating experimental design, measurement, and analysis of original research,
3) communicating and illustrating data from original research,
4) evaluating evidence, limitations, and broader themes from original data, and
5) development of skills in technical scientific writing.

## Assignment

For this assignment, you will combine elements of all previous course assignments (annotated bibliography, research paper sections, and data analysis activities) and submit an original research paper. Using notes from in-class discussion, example papers, and research papers of your own choosing, you will compile a final original research paper. For each section (Abstract, [Introduction](introduction.md), [Methods](methods.md), [Results](results.md), [Discussion](discussion.md), [Literature cited](annotated-bib.md)), refer to notes and rubrics from all previous assignments. Please incorporate all revisions suggested in previous assignments as you compile the report. In addition to the previous assignments, please include an Abstract, a short summary that conveys the major points from each section of the report (6-10 sentences).

Be sure to follow the Writing Cohesiveness tips in the previous sections, including an overall “hourglass” structure to the report. Please use parallel structure in the research questions, methods, and results. As always, organize writing within each paragraph starting with a topic sentence followed by supporting details and a transition to the next paragraph. A minimum of ten total references are required, however, more references may be needed to provide adequate support for rationale, justification of methods, and discussion of results. The final report should be approximately 2500-4000 words. Include appropriate in-text and bibliographic citations for all scientific literature referenced. Check spelling, grammar, and punctuation for accuracy. Use past tense to describe your methods and use active voice as much as possible.

For details on how to go about compiling the report, refer to comments on previous drafts, rubrics, and all class notes. Please review [The Structure, Format, Content, and Style of a Journal-Style Scientific Paper](http://jrtdd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Write-a-Paper-in-Scientific-Journal-Style-and-Format.pdf) reading. You may also refer to the [example research paper](https://github.com/jbcannon/REU/blob/main/resources/example_final_report.pdf). Refer to the [Scientific Style and Format Citation Quick Guide](https://www.scientificstyleandformat.org/Tools/SSF-Citation-Quick-Guide.html) for details on format for in-text and bilbliographic citations.
