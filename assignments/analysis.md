# Analyzing and presenting data

## Learning goals

The goal of this assignment is to give you experience analyzing and presenting your original data using some of the statistical and graphing techniques we have discussed in class.

## Assignment

Look over your introduction, and select a research question for which you have preliminary or final data. Review your experimental design and select an appropriate analysis with which to answer your research question. Refer to the webpage [Choosing the correct statistical test](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/) if you need a review of which tests are most appropraite for your data. First, analyze your data using an appropriate statistical analysis. Next, use the data and your analysis to answer the 3 questions listed below. Your responses should be approximately 300-400 words. You will find it helpful to consult the [rubric](#rubric) below for more details.

- Which statistical test did you chose to analyze the data and why was it appropriate to answer the research question asked (2–3 sentences)?
- Write a short (1–2 paragraph) results section. In your paragraph, address the following topics
  - Make a general statement describing the overall results. Where appropriate, use simple
calculations (means, median, percentages, differences, etc.) to emphasize the differences in
your response variable across experimental treatments or environmental gradient.
  - Report the statistics appropriate to the test you chose. The values to report include are specific test statistic you chose (e.g., t-value, F-value, slope, etc.), the P-value for your hypothesis test, and the appropriate degrees of freedom.
  - Write a short (1–2 sentences) interpretation of your results and how they relate to the research question asked.
- Using R or Excel, create a graph that demonstrates the results of your analysis. Be sure to include axis labels with units, a legend, a descriptive caption, and error bars or best fit line, where appropriate.
  - These guides can assist you with making [scatterplots](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/scatter-plots-r-base-graphs) and [bargraphs](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/bar-plots-r-base-graphs) using `base` R.
