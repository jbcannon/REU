# Developing an introduction

## Learning goals

This assignment is designed to allow you to demonstrate your knowledge in the following areas:

1) organizing a persuasive research rationale,
2) formulating and describing a quantifiable research question and hypothesis,
3) and effectively use citations of scientific literature.

## Assignment

For this assignment, you will draft an introduction that will eventually be incorporated into an original research paper. Using the entries you wrote for the [Annotated bibliography](annotated-bib.md) assignment, you will write an introduction section for your research paper. The content in the introduction should

1) convey adequate background material for readers to understand the importance of your research question(s),
2) review similar studies specifying known and unknown areas, and 
3) explicitly state your hypothesis or hypotheses and predictions.

Overall, the introduction should follow an “inverted triangle” structure with broad background information of interest to most readers leading to a specific rationale of your hypothesis. Organize writing with each paragraph starting with a topic sentence supported by several details or examples before transitioning to the next paragraph. Supporting information should come from scientific literature and include appropriate citations. A minimum of three references is required, however, 5-6 references are likely needed to provide adequate provide background information and support for your hypothesis. The introduction should be approximately 500 – 1000 words, typed, and double-spaced using a 12 point serif font. Please include a tentative title that is descriptive and concise. Also include [appropriate in-text and bibliographic citations](https://www.scientificstyleandformat.org/Tools/SSF-Citation-Quick-Guide.html) for all scientific literature that is referenced. Check all spelling, grammar, and punctuation for accuracy.

For details on how to go about writing an introduction please refer to class notes and read the “Introduction” section (pages 5 – 7) of [The Structure, Format, Content, and Style of a Journal-Style Scientific Paper](http://jrtdd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Write-a-Paper-in-Scientific-Journal-Style-and-Format.pdf) reading located in the course Resources folder. You may also refer to the example research paper included in the Resources folder. See also the [Scientific Style and Format Citation Quick Guide](https://www.scientificstyleandformat.org/Tools/SSF-Citation-Quick-Guide.html) for details on format for in-text and bibliographic citations.
