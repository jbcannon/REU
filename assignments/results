# Developing a results section

## Learning goals

This assignment is designed to allow you to demonstrate your knowledge in the following areas:

1) communicating results of original research via visual aids such as tables and figures,
2) communicating results of original research via written description, and
3) convey results of statistical analyses.

## Assignment

For this assignment, you will draft a Results section using notes from in-class discussion and data, tables, and figures generated from previous assignments. The content in the results section should

1) summarize the overall trends in your data,
2) visualize important data using tables or figures
3) digest major trends and present summary supporting information, and
4) explicitly link results to the appropriate research questions and methods they relate to.

Overall, the results section should clearly link to the specific research questions addressed in your introduction and methods. Like the methods, the results section should use a “parallel structure” where elements of your research question, methods, and results, are organized in a consistent order. The results section should begin with an overview of the major results. As always, organize writing within each paragraph starting with a topic sentence followed by supporting details and a transition to the next paragraph. In the results section, report all appropriate analyses, and statistical results (*t*-value, *F*-value, *P*-value, *r*<sup>2</sup>, etc.) needed to address your research questions. In addition to directly answering research questions, provide appropriate calculations (percentages, differences, etc.) that help support overall trends.

Be sure to merely report results, as it is not necessary to discuss or interpret them in this section. The results section should be approximately 250 – 500 words. Include appropriate in-text and bibliographic citations for any scientific literature that is referenced. Check all spelling, grammar, and punctuation for accuracy. Always use past tense to describe your results (even if you are still working on them!) and use active voice as much as possible. For details on how to go about writing a results section, refer to class notes, and read the “Results” section (pages 11 – 14) of [The Structure, Format, Content, and Style of a Journal-Style Scientific Paper](http://jrtdd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Write-a-Paper-in-Scientific-Journal-Style-and-Format.pdf) reading located in the course Resources folder. You may also refer to the example research paper included in the Resources folder. Refer to your [Annotated bibliography](annotated-bib.md) and the [Scientific Style and Format Citation Quick Guide](https://www.scientificstyleandformat.org/Tools/SSF-Citation-Quick-Guide.html) for details on format for in-text and bibliographic citations.
