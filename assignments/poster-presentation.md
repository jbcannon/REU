# Presenting a research poster

## Learning goals

This assignment is designed to allow you to demonstrate (1) effective communication of original research,
and (2) understanding of research methods and results.

## Assignment

For this assignment, you will deliver a poster presentation of your original research. Using the poster of your original research you created in the previous assignment, you will deliver a 5-7 minute presentation
of your research. Your presentation should convey the major points of your project and communicate the importance of the research and the questions you addressed. You should use the figures on your poster to
guide your description of the methods and results. You should not read from your poster, but rather summarize the main points of your poster and present it conversationally. Lastly, you should be
prepared to answer questions and defend decisions made at various points in your research project. You will be graded according to the attached rubric, and evaluation from your peers will also be included as
part of your score.

## Audience

The intended audience for your poster presentation is an undergraduate research conference. You can assume that the audience has a general undergraduate education in natural resources, ecology, or
biology, but you should define any terminology specific to your research. Note that after the course, you may present this research at an undergraduate or other research conference.

## Tips for poster presentation<sup>[1](https://www.scientifica.uk.com/neurowire/tips-for-presenting-your-scientificposter-at-a-conference)</sup>

- Your poster presentation should include the necessary background to introduce your topic to a broad audience who may not know much about your topic and should lead directly to the research question you addressed.
- Be sure to read your audience for feedback to ensure that points are understood clearly before moving forward.
- Your presentation should explain why the methods you used and the results you obtained were ideal for answering your question.
- Your presentation should conclude with the overall findings and how they related to your initial question and background information.
- Practicing your presentation is crucial: You should know exactly what all your figures mean and be able to explain them, and you should know all the key points to your research without reading notes.
- Be prepared for questions about your methods or other relevant material. Itâ€™s hard to predict what people may ask!
- Dress appropriately. For conferences in biology and ecology, formalwear (suit and tie is unnecessary), but professional and business casual dress is encouraged.
